## Introduction

Dreamforce, Salesforce's annual conference, is a gathering of thousands of technology professionals eager to learn about the latest trends and innovations in the Salesforce ecosystem. In the coming years, artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the conference experience. Imagine a Dreamforce where AI-powered assistants guide you through the event, personalized recommendations fill your schedule, and even the keynote speeches are enhanced by AI-generated insights.
